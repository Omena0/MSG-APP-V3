# MSG APP V3
### A message app with token auth.
#### Basically i control everyones accounts lol
##### And if you make an account the entire system breaks and logs you into admin idk why
###### But its more secure than nothing
###### I will add encryption if you pay me 1000€ rn
###### But that will make an entirely new version tbh
###### Get hyped for V4

It basically connects to auth server and sends hashed password + username and if they correct the server generate the client a token that they can use to send messages... Yes you need token for EVERY message lol

## Features:

- [ ] Encryption, and i mean any encryption...
- [X] Hashing! (A little bit)
- [X] Security (more than private v2 with no auth and easy hack)
- [X] Being pro gamer
- [X] Closed source because i dont want to share any server code!
- [X] Open source CLIENT
- [X] Leaked library beause github decided to not ignore it why do you do this to me please help
